current things that need changing:

    - obsidian: work out how to handle notes that do not yet exist
    - make sure that anki works correctly in obsidian
    - snippets
    - finish sorting which_key
    - make sure that obsidian links update when changed
    - obsidian daily note and todo stuff (templating, keybindings etc)
