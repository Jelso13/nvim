change mappings for cmp.lua
add comments in cmp.lua
manually define snippets for different languages and add as needed so there is no overhead
    potentially in its own repository

fix the autocomplete thing so that it only appears when I explicitly ask for it
    - otherwise it is a massive pain in the ass

comment in lps/handlers.lua different sections cos no idea what any of it does


make it so that visual line selection also applies commenting and such across lines - not sure why that isnt a thing to start with

also fix the auto indenting for braces - enter after open brace should close the brace and put cursor on new indented line


look at adding a debug adapter protocol (DAP) or whatever its called


Also handle specific note files so that they have highlighting and can nicely format notes



**** REMOVE SNIPPETS AND AUTOCOMPLETE THAT ARE USELESS AND INSTEAD MANUALLY DEFINE THEM FOR SPECIFIC LANGUAGES


Add specific configuration for my languages:
    - python
    - reactjs
    - flutter/dart
    - bash
    - rust
    - C
    - C++
    - Latex

Add completion menu for nerdfont icons and latex and maths symbols
