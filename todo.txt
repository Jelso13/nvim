change mappings for cmp.lua
add comments in cmp.lua
manually define snippets for different languages and add as needed so there is no overhead
    potentially in its own repository

fix the autocomplete thing so that it only appears when I explicitly ask for it
    - otherwise it is a massive pain in the ass
