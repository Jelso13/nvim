GENERAL PLAN:

    BLOAT OUT THE CONFIG
    MAKE IT A 'STABLE' BRANCH BY FIXING THE PLUGIN COMMITS AND A FEW OTHER THINGS
    GRADUALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PLUGINS AND TRY TO GET THE SAME FUNCTIONALITY FROM PURE LUA CONFIG WITHOUT PLUGINS




change mappings for cmp.lua
add comments in cmp.lua
manually define snippets for different languages and add as needed so there is no overhead
    potentially in its own repository

fix the autocomplete thing so that it only appears when I explicitly ask for it
    - otherwise it is a massive pain in the ass

comment in lps/handlers.lua different sections cos no idea what any of it does


make it so that visual line selection also applies commenting and such across lines - not sure why that isnt a thing to start with

also fix the auto indenting for braces - enter after open brace should close the brace and put cursor on new indented line


look at adding a debug adapter protocol (DAP) or whatever its called


Also handle specific note files so that they have highlighting and can nicely format notes



**** REMOVE SNIPPETS AND AUTOCOMPLETE THAT ARE USELESS AND INSTEAD MANUALLY DEFINE THEM FOR SPECIFIC LANGUAGES


Add specific configuration for my languages:
    - python
    - reactjs
    - flutter/dart
    - bash
    - rust
    - C
    - C++
    - Latex

Add completion menu for nerdfont icons and latex and maths symbols

Remove the functionality of some plugins that I only really need the core basis of - autopairs for example (I dont need the bindings for wrapping to specific locations for example)

remove the plugin for the snippets and handle it all locally with pre-defined snippets as I need them.
make the custom snippets work with the autocomplete menu and be filetype specific -> tex snippets in .tex files and never recommended outside of them


sort out lualine

Possible plugins to add
    * Codi              ~ interactive scratchpad useful for testing algorithms
