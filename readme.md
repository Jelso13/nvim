Want keybindings to still work in oil.nvim

Also want to return to separate paste buffers so that when I copy stuff and delete a new thing it isnt overridden
-  maybe could use the <leader>x or <leader>d to delete without copying like before instead?
print("Hello World")

Copilot:
-  make it so that a binding prompts for input only
-  no auto suggestions

# Jupyter Notebook
- neopter seems best (everything else doesnt support jupyter notebook 7)
