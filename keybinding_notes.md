Notes:
- by action first then object would allow more single-key bindings for other things
    - 

general:
\[ should be ~previous
\] should be ~next

p       project             related to current project
g       git                 related to the current git repository
f       file                related to the file currently being edited (actually buffer)
o       obsidian            related to my obsidian setup
h       help                related to help pages
q       quickfix            related to the quickfix list
t/<tab> tab                 related to tabs

w       window       ?      related to the windows - ctrl-w seems to cover it
l       lsp          ?      related to actions taken with the lsp - is this covered in file/project?

m       marks        ?      related to marks - maybe needed aside from baseline keys?
                            maybe a <leader>ms for marks show to display marks in file?
